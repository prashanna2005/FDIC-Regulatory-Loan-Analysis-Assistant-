FDIC RMS MANUAL OF EXAMINATION POLICIES
SECTION 3.2 – LOANS
STRUCTURED REGULATORY SUMMARY (EXAMINER-GRADE)
1. PURPOSE AND REGULATORY INTENT

Section 3.2 of the FDIC Risk Management Manual of Examination Policies establishes supervisory expectations related to the management of loan portfolios by insured depository institutions. The section focuses on credit risk management, loan policy governance, documentation sufficiency, and loan administration practices. It provides guidance for evaluating whether lending activities are conducted in a safe and sound manner.

This section does not prescribe loan approval decisions, underwriting formulas, or pricing standards. Its purpose is to assess the adequacy of processes, controls, and documentation, rather than to substitute examiner judgment for management decision-making.

2. BOARD AND MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT

Institutions are expected to demonstrate active oversight of lending activities by the board of directors and senior management. Oversight responsibilities include approving loan policies, monitoring credit risk exposure, and ensuring compliance with internal standards.

Examiners evaluate whether management practices are consistent with approved policies and whether deviations are identified, justified, and controlled.

3. LOAN POLICIES AND UNDERWRITING STANDARDS

Institutions must maintain written loan policies appropriate to their size, complexity, and risk profile. These policies should address:

Types of loans offered

Acceptable purposes and structures

Underwriting and approval standards

Documentation requirements

Collateral requirements and valuation practices

Risk limits and approval authorities

Problem loan identification and resolution

Examiners assess whether lending practices conform to policy and whether policies are periodically reviewed and updated.

4. LOAN DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

Adequate loan documentation is a fundamental supervisory expectation. Documentation should be sufficient to:

Evidence the borrower’s legal obligation to repay

Support the purpose and structure of the credit

Permit independent credit review

Enable ongoing loan monitoring

Missing, incomplete, or outdated documentation may indicate weaknesses in credit administration and elevate supervisory concern.

5. BORROWER REPAYMENT CAPACITY ANALYSIS

Institutions are expected to document the borrower’s ability to repay the loan according to its contractual terms. Depending on the loan type, this may include:

Financial statements

Income documentation

Cash flow analysis

Tax returns

Other verifiable financial information

Reliance on undocumented assumptions regarding repayment capacity is inconsistent with safe and sound lending practices. The absence of repayment analysis represents increased credit risk, even when loans are currently performing.

6. COLLATERAL AND SECURITY DOCUMENTATION

For secured loans, institutions should maintain documentation that:

Identifies the collateral securing the loan

Establishes ownership or control

Supports collateral valuation

Confirms lien priority and enforceability

Collateral should be periodically evaluated to ensure that values remain reasonable. While collateral may mitigate loss exposure, it does not replace the need for documented repayment capacity.

7. CREDIT RISK IDENTIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT

Institutions should have processes to identify and measure credit risk at both the individual loan level and portfolio level. This includes:

Risk rating systems

Loan classifications

Identification of credit concentrations

Monitoring changes in borrower condition or collateral value

Failure to identify emerging credit risk in a timely manner may indicate deficiencies in risk management practices.

8. LOAN ADMINISTRATION AND MONITORING

Effective loan administration requires ongoing monitoring throughout the life of the loan. Institutions are expected to:

Obtain updated financial information as required

Monitor compliance with loan terms and covenants

Track payment performance

Review collateral condition periodically

Weak monitoring practices may delay identification of credit deterioration.

9. PROBLEM LOAN IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION

Institutions should identify problem loans promptly and classify them in accordance with regulatory definitions. Examiner review focuses on whether:

Credit weaknesses are recognized timely

Risk ratings reflect current conditions

Management takes appropriate corrective action

Delays in recognizing problem loans may result in supervisory criticism.

10. LOAN REVIEW SYSTEMS

A sound loan review system is a key internal control. Effective loan review systems:

Operate independently from loan origination

Identify credit weaknesses early

Assess compliance with loan policies

Validate risk ratings and classifications

Loan review findings should be reported to senior management and the board of directors.

11. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT

Institutions should identify, monitor, and control concentrations of credit that could expose the institution to elevated risk. Concentrations may arise from:

Loan type

Industry

Geography

Borrower or related borrowers

Failure to manage concentrations appropriately may increase vulnerability to adverse economic conditions.

12. EXAMINER ASSESSMENT FOCUS

Under Section 3.2, examiners evaluate:

Adequacy of loan policies

Quality and completeness of loan documentation

Effectiveness of credit risk management

Timeliness of problem loan recognition

Management and board oversight

The focus is on process quality and risk management, not on loan approval decisions.

13. COMMON DEFICIENCIES IDENTIFIED BY EXAMINERS

Typical deficiencies observed under Section 3.2 include:

Incomplete or outdated financial information

Insufficient repayment capacity analysis

Weak or unsupported collateral valuations

Policy exceptions without proper justification

Ineffective loan review systems

Such deficiencies may elevate supervisory concern even when loans are performing.

14. EXPLICIT LIMITATIONS OF SECTION 3.2

Section 3.2:

Does NOT provide loan approval criteria

Does NOT establish pricing or underwriting formulas

Does NOT replace management judgment

Does NOT permit inference beyond documented facts

Does NOT authorize automated credit decisions

The section is strictly focused on loan risk management and documentation sufficiency.

15. REGULATORY APPLICATION BOUNDARY

This section is intended to guide examiner evaluation of lending practices and documentation quality. It should be applied consistently and proportionately, considering the institution’s size, complexity, and risk profile.
